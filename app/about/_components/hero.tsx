                        Christ College of Engineering (CCE), established in 2015, is affiliated to APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University, Thiruvananthapuram; and is recognized by AICTE, New Delhi. This college was found at a time when starting a new engineering college was not considered as a sensible proposition. In its short span of existence, exceeding all expectations and proving all critics wrong, Christ College of Engineering has managed to create ripples on the academic front in the university, so much so that today the college is being recognized as one of the best self-financing engineering colleges in Kerala.
