            Christ College of Engineering (CCE), established in 2015, is
            affiliated to APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University,
            Thiruvananthapuram; and is recognized by AICTE, New Delhi. This
            college was found at a time when starting a new engineering college
            was not considered as a sensible proposition. In its short span of
            existence, exceeding all expectations and proving all critics wrong,
            Christ College of Engineering has managed to create ripples on the
            academic front in the university, so much so that today the college
            is being recognized as one of the best self-financing engineering
            colleges in Kerala.
